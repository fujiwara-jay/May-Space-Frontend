        May Space is a capstone project developed by Group 8. Our goal was to create a seamless, user-friendly platform that allows users to easily find available rental units for their needs. Whether it's an apartment, condo, or house, May Space provides a variety of options to choose from, along with detailed specifications and features of each unit.

        This project is designed to simplify the process of renting a space, providing users with all the necessary information such as pricing, amenities, location, and contact details of property owners. We aim to help users make more informed decisions when choosing a rental property, and we hope our platform serves as a useful tool for both renters and property owners.
